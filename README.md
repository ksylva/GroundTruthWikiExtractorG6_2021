# GroundTruthWikiExtractorG6_2021

## What is'it ?
This tool allows to create csv files that will be used as cookies 
in the evaluation of the csv files obtained after the extraction of the tables on the wikipedia pages.

## How it works
* Enter your **url** (wikipedia) (or the **page title**) 
where the tables you want to extract are located in the text field;
* Select the extractor : _**java (html or wikitext), python**_; then you launch the extraction.
* Once finished, you can see the number of the different tables extracted in the _"table"_ drop-down list;
* By selecting a number, the content of the csv associated with 
this table will be displayed in the area just below, 
you can then correct any possible mismatches with the original table;
* Then finally save it.
A csv file whose name is in the format _"page_title_number_of_table".csv_ 
is created in the folder "groundTruth".
